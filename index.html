            <h3>Valtech UK: August 2011 to present:</h3>

            <p>As a senior front end consultant my main responsibilities have been the writing of frontend code for a number of projects to ensure that the site adheres to agreed designs, issues of cross browser compatibility (using feature detection techniques provided by modernizr.), producing html mock-ups of the site for future potential development.
            </p>
            <h3>Previous:</h3>

            Haymarket Media Group: March 2009 to July 2011:
            Working on Haymarket’s consumer division, main duties have been providing frontend support, working on a variety on sites including whatcar.com, autocar.co.uk, stuff, and whathifi.co.uk.

            Working as part of a full life cycle team, the role entails project estimation, code delivery, and QA process. Upon initial appointment main responsibility was to assist in the re-build of whatcar.com. This involved a great deal of liaison with the site’s stakeholders to ensure that the site was built to the agreed design. A major component of this work was ensuring that issues of browser inconsistencies were dealt with (through the mechanism of conditional CSS for Internet Explorer).

            Other responsibilities included updates to the site, and the addition of new UI features which has relied upon the use of Jquery. Development is under-taken within an agile methodology, utilizing a .Net MVC framework.
            Other responsibilities have included adding a “configurable skin” frontend code for autocar.co.uk and evecars.com. This has facilitated the ad sales team in being able to sell advertising skins on these sites. I also assisted in writing the frontend code for an image gallery for autocar.co.uk.

            I have been using JavaScript for 5 plus years (primarily form verification). In the last 4 years have been using jquery in web development - both using "off the shelf" plugins - and custom built jquery functions to manipulate DOM.

            Conchango: September to December 2008:
            As a member of the front-end development team, I worked on a number of different client projects, ranging from intranet applications to customer facing websites including Equiniti, River Island and Man Investments. Experienced in agile project methodology.
            On both the Equiniti and River Island projects, the development environment was MOSS 2007. My principle role was to work closely with backend (.net) developers to ensure that the site adhered to the design specifications. I was also required to ensure that the site meet agreed W3C WAI standards, and to offer advice to colleagues as to how these could be achieved.
            The Man Investments project required me to use (x)html, CSS and Jquery to produce site mock-ups, working in close collaboration with graphic designers, information architects and project managers to produce a working model of (what will be) their new site. Jquery was utilised to enhance UI elements within the site.

            Investis: April to August 2008:
            Work consisted of preparing a financial report for a multi-national bank. Specifically producing clean, accessible mark-up, and producing accessible data tables, along with site updates and enhancements as per client requests.

            Haymarket Media Group: Jan 2008 to March 2008:
            Work consists of updating of existing web sites, following in-house design guidelines to create of new compliant html/CSS templates and site components for future development work by back end developers.
            Sites worked on included blueboomerang.com, healthcarerepublic.com, brandrepublic.com, Campaign.

            Conchango: July 2007 ~ January 2008:
            Worked on a number of projects, both high-profile, public facing sites, and internal web based applications.
            Projects included:
            Harrods: Tasks included reviewing existing html and CSS mark-up, identify areas that needed attention (poor browser compatibility, usability improvements) and creating new CSS mark-up as new back-end functions were developed. http://www.harrods.com/harrodsstore/
            First Plus: Primary responsibility was to review existing html and CSS mark-up for the on-line loan application, and ensure that mark-up was correct, valid and browser, platform compatible.
            Also assisted other developers on the brochure-ware aspects of the site with ad-hoc formatting problems and ensuring that as great a level of W3C standards were meet as was possible (within the constraints of the development environment).
            Associated News: Re-styling of an existing internal web application to the specification supplied. Result was an intranet application, which was accessible and compliant.

            December 2006 ~ July 2007:
            Working for a number of different clients, including IMG Media Group and BDP Media Group, producing front-end code for existing and new projects. In all cases the role was to produce valid, accessible cross-browser mark-up.

            May 2000 to December 2006:
            Webmaster at Wolters Kluwer. Working within the Marketing Department of WKUK, main area of responsibility was the creation of compliant, accessible marketing collateral, and the maintenance of other online marketing assets in support of the company’s marketing strategy.

            February 1999 to May 2000:
